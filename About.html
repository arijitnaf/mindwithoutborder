Raghuram Rajan</h1>
   <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:centre;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 50px;color:white">"Rajan has written extensively on banking, corporate finance, international finance, growth and development, and organisational structures.[19][20] He is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate. He has collaborated with Douglas Diamond to produce much-cited work on banks, and their interlinkages with macroeconomic phenomena. He has worked with Luigi Zingales on the effect of institutions on economic growth, their research showing that development of free financial markets is fundamental to economic modernisation.[21] Rajan and Zingales built on their work to publish Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists in 2003. The book argued that entrenched incumbents in closed financial markets stifle competition and reforms, thereby inhibiting economic growth.[22] Rajan's 2010 book Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy examined the fundamental stresses in the American and the global economy that led to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. He argued that widening income inequality in the US, trade imbalances in the global economy, and the clash between arm's length financial systems, were responsible for bringing about the crisis.[23] The book won the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.</p>
